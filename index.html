            <p class="mb-2">PLOT:</p>
            <p>A young computer hacker unwittingly accesses a United States military supercomputer programmed to
                simulate, predict and execute nuclear war against the Soviet Union, triggering a false alarm that
                threatens to start World War III.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">FUN FACTS:</p>
            <p class="mb-2">At the 56th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Original Screenplay. It also won a BAFTA Award for Best Sound.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">The film is credited with popularizing concepts of computer hacking, information technology, and cybersecurity in wider American society.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">The studio had the Galaxian (1979) and Galaga (1981) arcade machines delivered to Matthew
                Broderick's home. He practiced for two months to prepare for the arcade scene.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">The WOPR, as seen in the movie, was made of wood and painted with a metal-finish paint. As
                the crew filmed the displays of the WOPR, Special Effects Supervisor Michael L. Fink sat inside and
                entered information into an Apple II computer that drove the countdown display.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">President Reagan was fascinated with the film. He signed a classified national security
                directive because of it. It was the first computer security directive given by a president.</p>
